1. **Purpose**:
    
    - Industry standard for calculating vulnerability severity.
    - Helps categorize and prioritize vulnerabilities based on their severity.
2. **Key Components**:
    
    - **Exploitability Metrics**:
        - **Access Vector**: How the vulnerability can be exploited (e.g., local, network).
        - **Access Complexity**: The complexity of exploiting the vulnerability (e.g., low, medium, high).
        - **Authentication**: Whether authentication is required for exploitation.
    - **Impact Metrics**:
        - **Confidentiality**: Impact on data confidentiality if exploited.
        - **Integrity**: Impact on data accuracy and trustworthiness.
        - **Availability**: Impact on system uptime and performance.
        
1. **Practical Use**:
    
    - CVSS scores are often calculated by scanning tools.
    - Security professionals should understand the scoring methodology to:
        - Manually calculate scores when needed.
        - Justify the scores applied to vulnerabilities.

#### **DREAD Model**

1. **Overview**:
    
    - Developed by Microsoft as a risk assessment framework.
    - Uses a 10-point scale to evaluate security threats and vulnerabilities.
2. **Five Key Factors**:
    
    - **Damage Potential**: The extent of harm caused if exploited.
    - **Reproducibility**: The ease with which the attack can be repeated.
    - **Exploitability**: The effort required to exploit the vulnerability.
    - **Affected Users**: The number or percentage of users impacted.
    - **Discoverability**: How easily the vulnerability can be found by attackers.
3. **Applications**:
    
    - Integral to Microsoftâ€™s security strategy for monitoring and responding to threats.
    - Helps IT professionals assess and prioritize security threats in Microsoft products and other environments.

#### **Severity Scoring and Prioritization**

1. **Combining CVSS and DREAD**:
    
    - Together, they provide a structured way to assess and prioritize vulnerabilities based on their risk and severity.
2. **Organizational Benefits**:
    
    - Allows teams to focus on addressing the most critical issues first.
    - Enhances understanding of vulnerabilities' exploitability and impact.
3. **Key Takeaway**:
    
    - Both CVSS and DREAD emphasize structured, repeatable processes for assessing risks, ensuring organizations can effectively manage their security posture.
