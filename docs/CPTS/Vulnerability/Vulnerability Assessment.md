### Notes on Vulnerability Assessment

1. **Definition and Purpose**:
    
    - Identifies and categorizes risks and security weaknesses in an environment.
    - Focuses on identifying issues without extensive manual exploitation.
    - Provides remediation steps to address identified vulnerabilities.
2. **Key Characteristics**:
    
    - Little to no manual exploitation; primarily relies on automated tools/scanners.
    - Some assessments may involve minimally invasive exploitation to confirm findings and rule out false positives.
3. **Customer Expectations**:
    
    - Clarify the scope and intent before starting the assessment.
    - Customers may request:
        - Validation of vulnerabilities through light exploitation.
        - A comprehensive report based solely on scanner findings.
4. **Importance of Vulnerability Management**:
    
    - Helps organizations:
        - Identify weaknesses in their assets.
        - Understand and categorize risk levels.
        - Prioritize and plan remediation efforts.
5. **Patch Testing**:
    
    - Essential to thoroughly test significant patches before deployment.
    - Prevents disruptions and ensures patches are compatible with the environment.

#### Threat

A `Threat` is a process that amplifies the potential of an adverse event, such as a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability. Some vulnerabilities raise more threat concerns over others due to the probability of the vulnerability being exploited. For example, the higher the reward of the outcome and ease of exploitation, the more likely the issue would be exploited by threat actors.

#### Exploit

An `Exploit` is any code or resources that can be used to take advantage of an asset's weakness. Many exploits are available through open-source platforms such as [Exploit-db](https://exploit-db.com/) or [the Rapid7 Vulnerability and Exploit Database](https://www.rapid7.com/db/). We will often see exploit code hosted on sites such as GitHub and GitLab as well.

#### Risk

`Risk` is the possibility of assets or data being harmed or destroyed by threat actors.

To differentiate the three, we can think of it as follows:

- `Risk`: something bad that could happen
- `Threat`: something bad that is happening
- `Vulnerabilities`: weaknesses that could lead to a threat

#### **Asset Inventory Overview**

1. **Purpose**:
    
    - Critical for effective vulnerability management.
    - Enables organizations to understand and protect assets, setting up proper defenses.
    
1. **Components of Asset Inventory**:
    
    - **Information Technology (IT)**: Hardware and software used in daily operations.
    - **Operational Technology (OT)**: Systems managing industrial processes.
    - **Physical Assets**: Devices, servers, and other physical infrastructure.
    - **Software Assets**: Locally installed and cloud-based software.
    - **Mobile Assets**: Smartphones, tablets, and other portable devices.
    - **Development Assets**: Resources used in software and system development.
    
1. **Asset Management Tools**:
    
    - Utilized to track and manage assets effectively.
    - Assets should be classified by data sensitivity to apply appropriate security and access controls.

#### **Application and System Inventory**

1. **Purpose**:
    
    - Create a thorough inventory of data assets for robust defensive security.
2. **Data Assets to Include**:
    
    - **On-Premises Storage**:
        - HDDs, SSDs, external drives, optical media, flash media, and legacy technologies (e.g., floppy disks, ZIP drives).
    - **Cloud Storage**:
        - Data stored with providers like AWS, GCP, Azure.
        - Multi-cloud environments require inventory across multiple providers.
    - **SaaS Applications**:
        - Includes consumer and business versions of services like Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, Office 365, and more.
    - **Applications**:
        - Both locally deployed and cloud-based applications critical to business operations.
    - **Networking Devices**:
        - Routers, firewalls, switches, hubs, IDS/IPS, DLP systems, and more.
3. **Key Considerations**:
    
    - Any threat to these assets can compromise information security and business operations.
    - Comprehensive assessment ensures no asset is overlooked.

#### **Maintaining and Updating Asset Inventory**

1. **Dynamic Nature of Assets**:
    
    - Organizations frequently add or remove devices, storage, and cloud resources.
    - Regular updates are essential to ensure the inventory remains accurate.
2. **Importance of Accuracy**:
    
    - Missing an asset in the inventory leaves it vulnerable to threats.
    - Thorough documentation is crucial for effective protection and management.
