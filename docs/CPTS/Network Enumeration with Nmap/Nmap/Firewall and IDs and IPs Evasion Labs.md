1.  Our client wants to know if we can identify which operating system their provided machine is running on. Submit the OS name as the answer.
	 ```shell
		 ubuntu
		```
 
 After the configurations are transferred to the system, our client wants to know if it is possible to find out our target's DNS server version. Submit the DNS server version of the target as the answer.
