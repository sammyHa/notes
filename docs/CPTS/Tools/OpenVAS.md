## **1. Introduction to OpenVAS**

OpenVAS is part of the Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) framework. It provides tools for scanning and identifying vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and web applications.

### **Key Features:**

- Comprehensive vulnerability scanning
    
- Regularly updated vulnerability database
    
- Integration with other tools for advanced penetration testing

## **2. Installation**

### **Prerequisites:**

- Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, or Kali Linux)
    
- Minimum 2 CPU cores and 4GB RAM (recommended)
    
- Root or sudo access
    

### **Step-by-Step Installation on Ubuntu/Debian:**

1. **Update the System:**
    
    ```
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```
    
2. **Add OpenVAS Repository (if not pre-installed):**
    
    ```
    sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mrazavi/openvas
    sudo apt update
    ```
    
3. **Install OpenVAS:**
    
    ```
    sudo apt install -y openvas
    ```
    
4. **Setup OpenVAS:**
    
    ```
    sudo gvm-setup
    ```
    
    The setup process may take some time as it updates the vulnerability database.
    
5. **Start OpenVAS Services:**
    
    ```
    sudo gvm-start
    ```
    
6. **Access the Web Interface:**
    
    - Open your browser and navigate to `https://<your-ip>:9392`.
        
    - Use the default credentials (admin/admin) or those generated during setup.
        

### **Common Troubleshooting:**

- Check logs for issues:
    
    ```
    sudo journalctl -u gvmd
    sudo journalctl -u ospd-openvas
    ```

## **3. Basic Usage**

### **3.1 Navigating the Web Interface:**

- **Dashboard:** Overview of scans, tasks, and vulnerabilities.
    
- **Tasks:** Manage and schedule vulnerability scans.
    
- **Reports:** View detailed scan results.
    

### **3.2 Performing a Basic Scan:**

1. Go to the **Scans** tab and select **Tasks**.
    
2. Click **New Task** and configure the target IP or range.
    
3. Select a scan profile (e.g., Full and Fast).
    
4. Start the scan and monitor its progress in real-time.
    

### **3.3 Interpreting Scan Results:**

- **Critical:** High-risk vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention.
    
- **High:** Exploitable vulnerabilities with significant risk.
    
- **Medium/Low:** Lesser impact but should still be addressed.

## **4. Advanced Configuration**

### **4.1 Creating Custom Scan Configurations:**

- Navigate to **Configuration > Scan Configs**.
    
- Clone an existing scan profile and modify settings, such as:
    
    - Specific ports or services to scan
        
    - Enabling/disabling certain NVTs (Network Vulnerability Tests)
        

### **4.2 Managing Targets:**

- Go to **Configuration > Targets**.
    
- Add multiple IP ranges, exclude certain hosts, or define custom settings like credentials for authenticated scans.
    

### **4.3 Credentialed Scanning:**

- Provides deeper insights by authenticating into systems.
    
- Add credentials under **Configuration > Credentials**.
    
    - Types: SSH, SMB, or web application credentials.
        
    - Assign them to specific targets.

## **5. Integration with Other Tools**

### **5.1 Exporting Scan Results:**

- Export reports in formats like XML, PDF, or CSV for further analysis.
    

### **5.2 Integration with Metasploit:**

- Export vulnerabilities from OpenVAS.
    
- Import them into Metasploit for targeted exploitation:
    
    ```
    msfconsole
    db_import /path/to/openvas_report.xml
    ```
    

### **5.3 Automation with Scripts:**

Use Python scripts and the `gvm-tools` package to automate tasks like:

- Scheduling scans
    
- Fetching reports
    

Install `gvm-tools`:

```
pip install gvm-tools
```

Example Script:

```
from gvm.connections import TLSConnection
from gvm.protocols.gmp import Gmp

with TLSConnection(hostname='localhost') as connection:
    with Gmp(connection) as gmp:
        gmp.authenticate(username='admin', password='password')
        tasks = gmp.get_tasks()
        print(tasks)
```

## **6. Advanced Penetration Testing with OpenVAS**

### **6.1 Exploiting Identified Vulnerabilities:**

1. Use OpenVAS reports to identify critical vulnerabilities.
    
2. Verify findings manually or with tools like:
    
    - Metasploit
        
    - Burp Suite
        

### **6.2 Testing Web Applications:**

- Use OpenVAS for reconnaissance and combine it with:
    
    - **OWASP ZAP** for dynamic analysis.
        
    - **Nikto** for web server testing.
        

### **6.3 Network Penetration Testing:**

- Perform network mapping and identify open ports using OpenVAS.
    
- Use tools like Nmap to validate findings and explore further.

## **7. Best Practices**

### **7.1 Regular Updates:**

- Update the vulnerability database frequently:
    
    ```
    sudo greenbone-feed-sync
    ```
    

### **7.2 Fine-tune Scan Configurations:**

- Avoid overloading the network by scheduling scans during non-peak hours.
    
- Test scan configurations in a lab environment before deploying.
    

### **7.3 Validate Results:**

- Not all reported vulnerabilities are exploitable. Validate them with manual testing or secondary tools.
    

### **7.4 Compliance and Reporting:**

- Use OpenVAS reports to demonstrate compliance with standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, or ISO 27001.
    
### Reporting
- The following will generate the report in the excel file
```bash
python3 -m openvasreporting -i report-downloaded-from-openvas.xml -f xlsx
```
